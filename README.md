# Clément Besnier

Bonjour !

My main interests are:

- medieval Germanic philology (Old Norse, Old/Middle High German), I provide code to parse corpora for :
  * [Old Norse](https://github.com/clemsciences/old_norse_corpus), [Old Norse dictionary (not finished)](https://github.com/clemsciences/old_norse_dictionary_zoega)
  * [Old Swedish](https://github.com/clemsciences/old_swedish_texts), [etymological dictionary of Swedish](https://github.com/clemsciences/old_high_german_texts), 
  * [runic inscriptions](https://github.com/clemsciences/old_norse_runes_db),  
  * [Old High German](https://github.com/clemsciences/old_high_german_texts) ;
  
- computational linguitics, I also contribute to [CLTK](https://github.com/cltk):
  * [presentation at Graz university in November 2019](https://github.com/clemsciences/cltk-2019-graz) with [a use case on the Nibelungenlied/Völsunga saga](https://github.com/clemsciences/comparison_sigurdr_siegfried), I added [a map to display places mentioned in the Nibelungenlied](https://github.com/clemsciences/nibelungen_map),
  * [Jupyter notebooks on Old Norse](https://github.com/clemsciences/old_norse_notebook),
  * [Old Norse corpus](https://github.com/cltk/non_texts), [tools for Old Norse](https://github.com/cltk/non_models_cltk) ;
  
- robotics, I especially like how measures can help track one's own position ([Kalman filtering](https://github.com/clemsciences/filtrage_kalman), [LiDAR code](https://github.com/gobgob/lidar-processor), [LiDAR notebooks](https://github.com/clemsciences/lidar-notebooks), [a web app to watch LiDAR measures](https://github.com/clemsciences/lidar-server-flask-vue)) ;

- mental health, I founded [Skilvit](https://github.com/skilvit) (seulement disponible en français), a [web app](https://www.skilvit.fr) which help patients to keep contact with their practicians, there is also an [Android app](https://github.com/skilvit/skilvit-android) which helps note one's feelings and behaviours.

[My web site](https://www.clementbesnier.fr) where I put thinks I worked on.

My [Youtube on channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZz4Zz79hldhYGIuIPIht5g?view_as=subscriber) on medieval Germanic literature (in French).
